6. **Atomic Data Insertion**: Ensures data consistency and eliminates potential errors by performing atomic insertion of data into the database.

7. **Well-Structured Patient Prescription**: Patient prescription information is organized, easy to access.

## Getting Started

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Open the project folder in the IDE of your choice.

2. Run `testmed.js` to generate a database of medicines, allergens, and side effects.

3. Start the server by running `app.js` using the following command:

   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

   This will open the server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

4. Modify the database connection settings in both `app.js` and `testmed.js` to match your database. By default, we are using MongoDB and connecting to `localhost:27017` or `0.0.0.0:27017`.

```javascript
// Example MongoDB connection settings
const mongoURI = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database-name';
```

## Database Configuration

Make sure to set up your MongoDB instance or adjust the database connection details according to your requirements in both `app.js` and `testmed.js`.

```javascript
mongoose.connect(mongoURI, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });
```
